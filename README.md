* We used the re module in this example, which supports regular expressions in Python.
* Furthermore, if the first parameter is not found in the second parameter, the re.search() method returns False.
* This method is better for verifying a regular expression than it is for extracting data. 
* The validity of alphabets, numerals, and special characters was checked using the re.search() method.
* The "s" function from the regular expression module is used to check for white spaces.
